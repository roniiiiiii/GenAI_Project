# Feminist AI Art â€“ University Project Using Generative AI

This project explores the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in analyzing and interpreting feminist artwork. The focus is on developing a custom object detection model trained specifically to recognize feminist themes and visual elements in artworks.

## Project Objective

The main goals of this project are to:
- Identify and highlight feminist motifs in visual art using AI
- Train a custom object detection model with annotated data
- Evaluate the model's performance on curated images
- Build an interactive application using Gradio for demonstrations

---

## Technologies & Tools

- Hugging Face `transformers` (Model: `facebook/detr-resnet-50`)
- Python & PyTorch
- Google Colab (for cloud-based training)
- Roboflow (for image annotation)
- Gradio (for the interactive demo)
- GitHub (for version control and collaboration)
